//Pretend youâ€™re writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items : health potions, torches, and arrows.
//Create an enum to identify the different types of items, and an std::array to store the number of each item the player is
//carrying(The enumerators are used as indexes of the array).The player should start with 2 health potions, 5 torches, and 10 arrows.
//Write a function called countTotalItems() that returns how many items the player has in total.
//Have your main() function print the output of countTotalItems() as well as the number of torches.
