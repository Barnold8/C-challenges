//In designing a game, we decide we want to have monsters, because everyone likes fighting monsters.
// Declare a struct that represents your monster.
// The monster should have a type that can be one of the following : an ogre, a dragon, an orc, a giant spider, or a slime.
// Use an enum class for this.
//Each individual monster should also have a name(use a std::string), as well as an amount of health that represents how much damage they can take before they die.
// Write a function named printMonster() that prints out all of the structâ€™s members.
//Instantiate an ogre and a slime, initialize them using an initializer list, and pass them to printMonster().
